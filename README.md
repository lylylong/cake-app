# Cake Lab

## Description

For those local stores that don't have an online store/website, working with the delivery apps is the only way to keep their small-business survival during the covid-19 pandemic. Now they have more options!!

We are introducing "Cake Lab"!

A lot of our local store owners having a hard time keeping track of their orders without having to use big names like " Uber Eats" who take a big part of their profits. So we decided to come up with an app that allows taking orders as well as reviewing their choice of baked goods. Bakeries/Restaurants can now easily keep track of their orders as well as customers can easily see reviews of best sellers and maybe what to stay away from. Any restaurant business could use this app, it's super simple to use and navigate, here is the user process:

1. When you visit this website, you can see the welcome page as your first station:\

2. A lot of new customers may want to learn more about the products before they register as a member to purchase orders. The gallery page is open for all users. New customers don't need to register to see the product Infos. When you click on the gallery page, you can see the popular cake categories and flavours, for example, you can learn that the chocolate cake is the best seller.\

3. When you scroll down, under the photo library, you can see the latest orders, the most recent one is just added and you can find it on the top of the list!\

4. You can see what are other people ordered, and also the reviews, and how many people like this cake, but you can’t leave a comment at this moment — you need to login first.\

5. After checking these photos and product details, new customers are more likely to signup. When you move to the login/order page, you will find the two functions are in one tab, this reminds people to log in before ordering the cakes, so let’s create an account now. You can see the left-side is for returning users, and the other side is for new users.\

6. After you created an account, you’ll see the order dashboard.\

7. To create an order is very easy, choose the cake flavour, cake category, pickup date from the dropdown lists, and click the “submit order’ button.\
